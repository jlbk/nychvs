## Installation

Clone, and a vanilla Python 2.7 installation should run the script fine.

## Example

    ./nychvs/parse.py raw/dat/uf_14_occ_web_b.txt 2014 schema/occ_2014.json > data/occ_2014.tsv

## Opening the file

To open in Excel, you may need to rename the `.tsv` file to `.csv` then select
"tab" as the delimiter.
